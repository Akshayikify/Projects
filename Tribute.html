        <h1>Who is Swami Vivekanada?</h1>
        <ul>
            <h3>Early life:</h3>
            <li><strong>Vivekananda</strong> was born as Narendranath Datta (name shortened to Narendra) in  Calcutta,the capital of British India, on 12 January 1863.</li>
            <li>His father, Vishwanath Datta, was an attorney at the Calcutta High Court and his mother was Bhubaneswari Devi.</li>
            <li>Narendranath was interested in spirituality from a young age and used to meditate before the images of deities such as Shiva, Rama.</li>
            <h3>Education:</h3>
            <li>In 1871, at the age of eight, Narendranath enrolled at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Metropolitan Institution, where he went to school until his family moved to Raipur in 1877.</li>
            <li>n 1879, after his family's return to Calcutta, he was the only student to receive first-division marks in the Presidency College entrance examination.</li>
            <li>He was also interested in Hindu scriptures, including the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana"><em>Ramayana</em></a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata"><em>Mahabharata</em></a> and the <em>Puranas</em>.</li>
            <h3>His spirituality...</h3>
            <li>At the age of 18 he met Ramakrishna, later becoming a devoted follower and sannyasin (renunciate).</li>
            <li>In 1893 he traveled to the United States where he participated in the Parliament of Religions in Chicago. Here he delivered a famous speech beginning with the words: <em><strong>"Sisters and brothers of America ..."</strong></em> introducing the ancient Hindu religious tradition to Americans.</li>
            <li>He founded the Vedanta Society of New York and the Vedanta Society of San Francisco (now Vedanta Society of Northern California)which became the foundations for Vedanta Societies in the West.</li>
            <li>In India, he founded the Ramakrishna Math, which provides spiritual training for monastics and householders, and the Ramakrishna Mission, which provides charity, social work and education.</li>
            <li>His initial beliefs were shaped by Brahmo concepts, which denounced polytheism and caste restrictions,and proposed a "streamlined, rationalized, monotheistic theology strongly coloured by a selective and modernistic reading of the Upanisads and of the Vedanta.</li>
            <li><em>Rammohan Roy</em>, the founder of the Brahmo Samaj who was strongly influenced Swami Vivekanada.</li>
            <li>Vivekananda was more influenced by the Brahmo Samaj and its new ideas than by Ramakrishna.</li>
            <li>One day, Narendra asked Ramakrishna to pray to the goddess Kali for his family's financial welfare. Ramakrishna instead suggested he go to the temple himself and pray.</li>
            <li>Narendra went to the temple three times, but did not pray for any kind of worldly necessities.</li>
            <li>He ultimately prayed for true  <strong>knowledge</strong> and <strong>devotion</strong> from the goddess.</li>
            <li>He gradually became ready to renounce everything for the sake of realising God, and accepted Ramakrishna as his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru" target="_blank">Guru</a>.</li>
            <h3>His tragic death...</h3>
            <li>On 4 July 1902 (the day of his death) Vivekananda awoke early, went to the monastery at Belur Math and meditated for three hours.</li>
            <li>He taught Shukla-Yajur-Veda, Sanskrit grammar and the philosophy of yoga to pupils, later discussing with colleagues a planned Vedic college in the Ramakrishna Math.</li>
            <li>At 7:00 pm Vivekananda went to his room, asking not to be disturbed; he died at 9:20 p.m. while meditating.</li>
